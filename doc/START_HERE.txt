PropellerGuide.md has all the important info on getting started with the engine.

If some information is missing, its better to ask the engine developer than do something the wrong way.

./doc/ExampleCode/ directory has examples on basic functionality of the engine.

"Game" project should have some old project, you can also look into that code and start from there.

If you view PropellerGuide.md from your Github repo, it will display the document with better formatting.
